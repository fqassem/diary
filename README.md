# Diary - A Simple Personal Blog Publisher

## Running the app

- _cd_ into the _diary-backend_ folder and _npm install_, then _npm run start_ to start the server. The server runs on port 3000
- _cd_ into the _diary-frontend_ folder and *npm install, then  _npm run start_ to start the front end dev server. The front end runs on port 8000, but the api requests are proxied to port 3000 to avoid CORS issues

Navigate to localhost:8000 and start messing around.
